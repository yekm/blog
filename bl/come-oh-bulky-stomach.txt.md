## Come Oh Bulky Stomach


Come Oh bulky stomach Ganapati,  
You are the son of Shiva Parvati

Riding a Rat-o, Belting a serpent-o,  
Riding a Rat-o, Belting a serpent-o,  
You have the face of an elephant-o

Come Oh bulky stomach Ganapati,  
You are the son of Shiva Parvati

We offer you modaka payasa,  
You are the steno of Veda Vyasa  
Please guide us Oh Vigna Vinasha  
You are the God of examination pass-a

Come Oh bulky stomach Ganapati,  
You are the son of Shiva Parvati
