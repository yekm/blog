## Pehla Karo Pranaam, Sadguru Ko


Pehla karo pranaam, sadguru ko (2)  
Sri guru ko pranaam sadguru ko

Give me a voice, that echoes your name  
Give me a note to sing your praise  
Give me eyes to see your grace  
Give me hands, give me a chance to serve you

Pehla karo pranaam, sadguru ko (2)  
Sri guru ko pranaam sadguru ko

Give me a mind, that revels in you  
Give me a heart, that belongs to you  
Give a soul that abides in you  
Give me hands, give me a chance to serve you
